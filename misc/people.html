							<h3>Jacob Scott, MD</h3>
								Principal Investigator<br>
								Physician-Scientist<br>
								Associate Staff, Departments of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research and
								Radiation Oncology

								</p>

								<p> I am a veteran of the US Navy submarine force turned academic physician-scientist. Our lab pursues research decomposing the complexity of cancer through mathematical modeling and the biological and clinical validation of these models. My educational background in physics, medicine, mathematics and engineering gives me a unique perspective on cancer and systems biology and I am able to communicate and collaborate with professionals across many disciplines. I have worked extensively on mathematical modeling of cancer evolution and treatment using a variety of models including evolutionary game theory, cellular automata, differential equations and Markov chains. My DPhil thesis focused on the role of heterogeneity, both genetic and microenvironmental, on cancer evolution and radiation response, and my laboratory’s focus is cancer evolution and therapy resistance. Since starting Theory Division, we have begun to diversify, and the lab now has a significant experimental component, conducting experimental evolution in cancer cell lines as well as bacteria. The combination of mathematics, experimental evolution and a clinical focus makes our laboratory stand out as one of the most interdisciplinary in the field of translational cancer evolution and evolutionary medicine.  I am eager to use my distinct perspective to help advance this field to help cancer patients.</br>

					<p>The first patient, whom I saw as a medical student, was suffering with an incurable disease.  This experience motivated me to step into the field of scientific research trying to find something new that may benefit medical treatment.  My research interest is to understand how extrinsic environment modifies intrinsic molecular programs that control critical cellular decisions such as cell cycle progression, cell death, and cell fate choice.  Currently I am studying  the asymmetric cell division in cancer stem cells and the therapeutic resistance in cancer cells.  In daily life, I occasionally find that the pair of socks I am wearing are asymmetrical.

						<p>I am a postdoctoral research fellow working on dynamical modeling of tumor cell populations using a combination of dyanmical systems theory and stochastic models. My principle interest is the study of the emergence of resistance in the tumors developed during cancer therapy. The main purpose of the research is to find optimal strategies of utilizing available treatments to cure cancers.<br>

							<p>I am a joint postdoc with the Mathematical Biosciences Institute at Ohio State University.
							Currently, I am investigating the emergence of resistance to castration therapy in patients with prostate cancer.
							I am also interested in applications of deep learning in automated segmentation of structures from MRIs.
							When I am not coding and doing math, I like to bike, play basketball/soccer and watch soccer games. <br>

						<p>I am currently pursuing a DPhil in Oncology at the University of Oxford, co-supervised by Dr. Jacob Scott, Dr. Francesca Buffa,
						and Dr. Adrian Harris. My DPhil thesis is focused on the roles of non-coding RNA (microRNA and circular RNA) in cancer.
						As I have trained in medicine and mathematics, my interests span clinical neurology and oncology, medical genetics, computational biology,
						and mathematical biology. I also love to learn about people and cultures, spend time with friends, run, and read!

						<p>Artem is developing algorithmic biology: using theoretical computer science to structure evolutionary theory. Unlike physics-inspired theories, algorithmic biology doesn’t rely on simple well-controlled systems but abstracts over arbitrary micro-dynamics. As such, Artem views poorly-characterized cancer cells not as a domain in which to apply existing biological knowledge, but an experimental system with which to learn about evolution. You can find him working on his DPhil in the Computer Science department at the University of Oxford, supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/peter.jeavons/">Peter Jeavons</a> and Jake. He also thinks about evolutionary game theory and philosophy of science and works closely with David Basanta and Andriy Marusyk.

							<p>
							I am currently a PhD Candidate in Systems Biology and Bioinformatics at Case Western Reserve University’s School of Medicine. My research is focused on evolution of therapeutic resistance in cancers, both experimentally and computationally. Experimentally, I am working on evolving resistance to standard of care treatments for Ewing Sarcoma, and assaying secondary treatment effectiveness throughout this evolution. Computationally, I am exploring the more theoretical concept of drivers and passengers in cancer, and their effect on clonal structure. Outside of the lab, I like to cook, swim, and spend time with my rabbit, Kat.

          <p>I'm a radiation oncologist who specializes in the care of patients with Sarcoma and a theoretical biologist who thinks about the fundamental evolutionary mechanisms driving therapeutic resistance in cancer and pathogens. When I'm in the lab, I think about the evolution of resistance and spend my time working with, and mentoring my lab mates - with whom I feel incredibly lucky and honored to work.

        <p> I am a postdoctoral research fellow studying how various factors including population demography, relative fitness, and mutation rates affect the evolution of antibiotic resistance. I also draw on my experience in experimental evolution to address similar questions in cancer, such as whether and how collateral resistance profiles of evolving cancer populations change throughout time. As a postdoc in Theory Division, my goals are to become better grounded in the theoretical aspects of biology and do translational work that will better the lives of others. Outside of lab, I am dedicated to promoting inclusive diversity; I also enjoy cooking, exploring hiking trails, and bar trivia. </p>

        <p> I am a research technician for the Scott Lab. Trained in biochemistry & applied math, I am interested in bridging wet lab and dry lab to understand how game theory can be used to predict treatment regimens for cancer. Outside of lab, I am interested in educational policy and teaching, and when I'm not struggling to (re)learn python I enjoy hiking, marveling at dogs that pass by, and not skiing. </p>

          I am currently doing research on modeling fitness landscapes and evolutionary trajectories of drug resistance eventually aiming for predictions applicable in therapeutical settings.

        <p> I am a medical student at <a href="https://case.edu/medicine/">Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine</a> who is interested in cancer research. I am trying to answer some questions in cancer using dynamical systems modelling for cell population growth. Right now, I am particularly interested in spatial structure of cell populations and how this structure could affect the development of cancer. Before I started working on this project, I thought I would have to stop doing math while being a med student. Now I realize I can do both! When I'm not doing research or enjoying medical school, I love playing sports, in particular soccer, tennis, or any sport where effort can make up for lack of talent. </p>

        <p>The first patient I saw as a medical student was suffering with an incurable disease.  
          This experience motivated me to step into the field of scientific research trying to find something new that may benefit medical treatment.  
          My research interest is to understand how extrinsic environment modifies intrinsic molecular programs that control critical cellular decisions such as cell cycle progression, cell death, and cell fate choice.  
          Currently I am studying  the asymmetric cell division in cancer stem cells and the therapeutic resistance in cancer cells.  
          In daily life, I occasionally find that the pair of socks I am wearing are asymmetrical. </p>

            Hailing from Huntsville, AL, I studied biomedical and electrical engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, where I also competed in track and cross country. 
            In the Theory Division, I am exploring the application of fitness seascapes to evolutionary medicine. 
            I am also interested in improving the tractability- or utility- of fitness landscapes in cancer therapy and borrowing principles from quantum mechanics to better understand and control cancer evolution. 
            Along with research, I enjoy running, climbing, good food, and good coffee.

          <p> I am a postdoctoral research fellow studying evolution in both cancer and bacteria. My current focus is on using game theory to better steer evolution in heterogeneous populations.
            While my background is in Physics, I’ve become obsessed with understanding evolution as a means to better understanding and curing diseases.
            For my PhD, I studied evolution through the lens of collateral sensitivity (experimentally and computationally) as a member of the <a href="https://woodlab.biop.lsa.umich.edu/">Wood lab</a> at the University of Michigan.
            Outside of the lab, I enjoy walking my amazing dogs (Cloud and Freya), watching the Chicago Bulls and Blackhawks, and playing games with

            University</a>.
          In lab, I'm researching clinical biomarkers for the prediction of chemotherapy response in various types of cancer.
	  I use open-source databases (like <a href="https://www.cancerrxgene.org/">GDSC</a> and <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga">TCGA</a>) and open-source software (like Python and R).
          When I’m not in class, I can usually be found feeding my dog way too many treats or trying restaurants around town. </p>

          <p>Geoff is another wayward physicist who found his way into our lab from the hallowed halls of the <a href="https://case.edu/medicine/">Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine</a>. While he isn't in lab he is busy commuting back and forth to NYC and playing Chopin etudes at his parent's house. He is currently working on helping us deconstruct our underlying models of radiation oncology. </p>
